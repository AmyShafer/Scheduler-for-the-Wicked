## Technologies

This website was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript wizardry.

Users do not need setup and users do not need to be alive.

## Mockup

Spell-cast picture below demon-strates the awesome power of the Scheduler for the Wicked.

## Resources-used

## Possible-improvements

The Living suggested adding a toggle that changes the scheduler "normal" to "wicked" but The Dead could not be bothered.

A vampire desired the favicons take up the entire button and than changed to the text "Skull Save" when the user hovered over but the vampire never chips in for gas so his request was ignored.
